**Description:** 
Koda is a freckled, blonde haired enby who took to their First Change more easily than most. Once the dust settled, they found themselves fascinated by humans, drawn towards the flashing lights of civilization and the comforts of air conditioned homes. He quickly took to technology, gadgets, phones, video games. The wild seemed so much tamer compared to the constant deluge of entertainment he discovered. 
A joke he tossed around in his head, a werewolf gaming streaming channel, “LycanSubscribe”. He registered the channel without thinking much of it, but within a few months he’d begun streaming while playing _Destiny_. As he played, his boisterous and excitable personality and dramatic howls of triumph drew an audience. What he sometimes lacked in skill he more than made up with bravado. The performance of it all came naturally to him. He always found it harder to relate to other Garou, so he kept his head and ears lowered, eager to show his belly to higher ranked pack mates at the slightest sign of conflict. But when he’s gaming in front of an audience he feels the thrill of competition shooting through his veins. If you were to check the arms of his computer chair or edges of his desk you’d find the slashes and peeling from when he started to lose his cool and start growing claws, almost shifting from his focus and intensity. 
More recently he’s started having nightmares, visions of faces he doesn’t recognize. Something feels wrong, like he’s on the edge of something important. But for the time being, he doesn’t know what to do other than flick his webcam on and start shooting.
