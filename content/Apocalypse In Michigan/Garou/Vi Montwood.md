**Description:** 
Vi had a difficult time adjusting when she experienced her first change, the young wolf suddenly finding her mind opened and changed, alienating her from the pack and life she’d known and ultimately burdening her with the knowledge of the apocalypse. Her mother, [[Diane Montwood|Glade-Caller]], gently pushed her towards reconciling her duty as a garou. Her fiery sense of righteous anger now has focus: fighting the wyrm to protect that which she loves and defend those who can't defend themselves. 
Vi still spends as much time as she can in her lupus form, preferring the earth under her paws and the simplicity of a feral life, but she found she couldn’t outrun that sense of duty her mother instilled in her. She found a job at a local animal rescue where she’s made some human friends and infrequently volunteers at a local women's shelter. 
Much of Vi's body language and demeanor still lean towards wolf: she didn't ask to be garou and even in homid form humans often find her to be brusque and direct. But those who work and volunteer with her see her drive to help others and learn what she can and see her intentions. She avoids prolonged eye contact to avoid challenging and with those in her pack and the rare human she becomes close to, she becomes more physical in expressing her comfort, expressing her calm through closeness and touch. 
Her wardrobe is focused almost entirely on comfort, with some tweaking by [[Eve Montwood|Eve]] much to Vi's distaste at first. She keeps her hair short, less hassle that way. Lots of sweatpants, leggings, jeans and tank tops. The few graphic tees she owns are hand-me-downs from [[Eve Montwood|Eve]] and she still has the two witchy outfits [[Eve Montwood|Eve]] assembled for her first human parties. (edited)
