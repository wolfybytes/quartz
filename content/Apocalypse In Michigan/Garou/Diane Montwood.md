**Description:** 
Glade-Caller is a relatively calm Garou most of the time, and indeed often is consulted for wisdom by the Sept’s other elders. Often having to serve as the counter balance of wisdom to the Rage of the Get, she is not afraid to tell the Get when she thinks that they’re being idiots, as is perfectly willing to back that up with tooth and claw if she needs to. Other than that, she also tends to be a sort of Mother Hen to the Sept. Although, she at times can be aloof and will be noticeably annoyed and snappy if interrupted while she’s working on something, particularly if that something is important.

**Relationships**:
Family: [[Vi Montwood|Vi]], [[Eve Montwood|Eve]], [[Kolina Montwood|Kolina]]
